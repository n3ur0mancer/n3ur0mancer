# Hi there ü´∂

I'm a full stack web developer with a strong focus on crafting meaningful user experiences. I have a keen interest in all things design, with a particular focus on UI/UX. I love exploring the intersection of aesthetics and functionality.

Beyond coding, I'm an avid explorer of various technologies, from 3D printing and amateur radio to IoT projects. I try to strike a balance between my digital endeavors and outdoor adventures - dabbling in ultralight hiking, training for my first triathlon and hopefully soon activating some SOTA spots. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate!
