# Hi there 👋

I'm a full stack web developer with a strong focus on creating delightful user experiences. I have a keen interest in all things design, with a particular focus on UI/UX. I love exploring the intersection of aesthetics and functionality.

Beyond coding, I'm an avid explorer of various technologies, from 3D printing and amateur radio to IoT projects. I believe in striking a balance between my digital endeavors and outdoor adventures, embracing ultralight hiking, hopefully soon SOTA activations and other outdoor activities to fuel my creativity and gain fresh perspectives.
